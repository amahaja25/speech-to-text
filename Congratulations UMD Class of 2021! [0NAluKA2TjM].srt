00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Welcome to the University of Maryland Spring 2021 Commencement Ceremony.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,120
Congratulations to the classes of 2020 and 2021.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,080
We are emerging as fearless Terps, more thoughtful and more kind because of our experience.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,840
We now have a new Kairos, a uniquely opportune time to decide how to move our society into a better future.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,680
The curve of the future is yours to bend and that ultimately is why I am an optimist. Your

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,040
commitment to justice, to equity, to driving meaningful change is unlike anything that any of

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,320
us have seen before. How about a round of applause to the graduates? There has been a theme

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,080
in today's ceremony and that theme is this. From great adversity and challenge, we will rise.

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,920
Your years here have equipped you with everything you need to take on the grand challenges of our

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,640
time. You have displayed grit and confidence and perseverance and now the world needs you.

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,120
You are Terrapin Strong. Good luck and go Terps!

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,000
Please welcome the best mascot in the country,

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,320
Hestudo! Turn your castle!
