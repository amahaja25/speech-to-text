Welcome to the University of Maryland Spring 2021 Commencement Ceremony.

00:08.480 --> 00:13.120
Congratulations to the classes of 2020 and 2021.

00:17.040 --> 00:24.080
We are emerging as fearless Terps, more thoughtful and more kind because of our experience.

00:24.080 --> 00:31.840
We now have a new Kairos, a uniquely opportune time to decide how to move our society into a better future.

00:34.800 --> 00:41.680
The curve of the future is yours to bend and that ultimately is why I am an optimist. Your

00:41.680 --> 00:49.040
commitment to justice, to equity, to driving meaningful change is unlike anything that any of

00:49.200 --> 00:56.320
us have seen before. How about a round of applause to the graduates? There has been a theme

00:56.320 --> 01:04.080
in today's ceremony and that theme is this. From great adversity and challenge, we will rise.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.920
Your years here have equipped you with everything you need to take on the grand challenges of our

01:11.920 --> 01:20.640
time. You have displayed grit and confidence and perseverance and now the world needs you.

01:21.680 --> 01:27.120
You are Terrapin Strong. Good luck and go Terps!

01:27.840 --> 01:34.000
Please welcome the best mascot in the country,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.320
Hestudo! Turn your castle!
