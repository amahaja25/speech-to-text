00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,740
My fellow Terps, I am pleased to welcome all of you to the first day of the 2021 spring

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,120
semester.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,160
We begin this semester in extraordinary times.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,680
We recently inaugurated Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States, following

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,920
an election that left our nation deeply divided, and just days from a deadly assault on the

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,240
U.S. Capitol, less than 10 miles from our campus, the insurrection was also a painful

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,720
reminder of the racial inequities that remain in our country.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,000
Last year, many members of our community lifted up their voices and took action to combat

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,260
long-standing racial injustice.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,000
This semester, that fight must continue.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,160
We continue to do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,400
Like we did in the fall, we have implemented significant health measures.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,480
For the next 14 days, all classes will be delivered online.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,920
And we ask all students to sequester as much as possible.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,520
We are doubling the frequency of COVID testing for our community and are actively working

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,880
on a campus-wide vaccination distribution plan.

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,040
Even as a vaccine offers hope for the future, it is critical that we continue to wear masks,

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,280
both inside and outside, avoid large gatherings, and maintain physical distancing.

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,920
I thank all of you, especially our students, for creating a culture that holds ourselves

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,880
accountable for Maryland.

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,480
Let's keep it up.

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,760
Ensuring a strong democracy, building a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive community,

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,040
or serving the health of our friends and loved ones, these are just some of the grand

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,240
challenges of our time.

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,680
As we begin a new semester, I ask every member of our community, faculty, staff, and students

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,680
to recommit yourself to fearless grand ideas.

27
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,320
We all must play an active role in creating the world that we want.

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,960
Again, welcome back to the University of Maryland and congratulations on being part of our robust

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,560
and innovative academic and research community.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,960
Together, we will pursue excellence in everything that we do.

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,440
So don't forget, wear your mask, and remain Terrapin Strong and Go Terps!
