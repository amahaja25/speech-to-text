00:00.000 --> 00:09.740
My fellow Terps, I am pleased to welcome all of you to the first day of the 2021 spring

00:09.740 --> 00:11.120
semester.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.160
We begin this semester in extraordinary times.

00:14.160 --> 00:19.680
We recently inaugurated Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States, following

00:19.680 --> 00:24.920
an election that left our nation deeply divided, and just days from a deadly assault on the

00:24.920 --> 00:31.240
U.S. Capitol, less than 10 miles from our campus, the insurrection was also a painful

00:31.240 --> 00:35.720
reminder of the racial inequities that remain in our country.

00:35.720 --> 00:41.000
Last year, many members of our community lifted up their voices and took action to combat

00:41.000 --> 00:43.260
long-standing racial injustice.

00:43.260 --> 00:49.000
This semester, that fight must continue.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.160
We continue to do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.400
Like we did in the fall, we have implemented significant health measures.

00:58.400 --> 01:03.480
For the next 14 days, all classes will be delivered online.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.920
And we ask all students to sequester as much as possible.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.520
We are doubling the frequency of COVID testing for our community and are actively working

01:12.520 --> 01:15.880
on a campus-wide vaccination distribution plan.

01:15.880 --> 01:22.040
Even as a vaccine offers hope for the future, it is critical that we continue to wear masks,

01:22.040 --> 01:28.280
both inside and outside, avoid large gatherings, and maintain physical distancing.

01:28.280 --> 01:33.920
I thank all of you, especially our students, for creating a culture that holds ourselves

01:33.920 --> 01:36.880
accountable for Maryland.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.480
Let's keep it up.

01:41.480 --> 01:47.760
Ensuring a strong democracy, building a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive community,

01:47.760 --> 01:52.040
or serving the health of our friends and loved ones, these are just some of the grand

01:52.040 --> 01:54.240
challenges of our time.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.680
As we begin a new semester, I ask every member of our community, faculty, staff, and students

02:00.680 --> 02:04.680
to recommit yourself to fearless grand ideas.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.320
We all must play an active role in creating the world that we want.

02:09.320 --> 02:14.960
Again, welcome back to the University of Maryland and congratulations on being part of our robust

02:14.960 --> 02:18.560
and innovative academic and research community.

02:18.560 --> 02:24.960
Together, we will pursue excellence in everything that we do.

02:24.960 --> 02:31.440
So don't forget, wear your mask, and remain Terrapin Strong and Go Terps!
