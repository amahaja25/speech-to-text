# speech-to-text



<strong>Here are my expansive thoughts: </strong>

I thought the speech-to-text was done incredibly well, and I am really impressed! I didn't catch a single mistake in the transcript from whisper when I rewatched the video of Pines talking. Even when he wore the mask and his voice got a little muffled, the text was perfect. I do, however, think that the video I chose made it easier for the speech-to-text to work as well as it did. Since there was only one person talking, limited background noise and the audio was recorded on high-quality professional equipment (at least I am assuming), the text was easier to get right. Since it took only a short amount of time to get the text, I tried a second video that had more people speaking because I wanted to see if there would be a difference in the quality of the text I got. The second video was not as accurate as the first one, primarily towards the end where Testudo became "Hestudo" and tassle became "castle." I also noticed the transcript I got was not the exact same as the captions on the YouTube video itself, which I thought was really interesting. I still didn't get to see what the text would look like if two people were to talk concurrently and their voices overlap each other, so I do want to try that out next.
