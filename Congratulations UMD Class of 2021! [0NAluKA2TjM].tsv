17040	24080	We are emerging as fearless Terps, more thoughtful and more kind because of our experience.
24080	31840	We now have a new Kairos, a uniquely opportune time to decide how to move our society into a better future.
34800	41680	The curve of the future is yours to bend and that ultimately is why I am an optimist. Your
41680	49040	commitment to justice, to equity, to driving meaningful change is unlike anything that any of
49200	56320	us have seen before. How about a round of applause to the graduates? There has been a theme
56320	64080	in today's ceremony and that theme is this. From great adversity and challenge, we will rise.
65280	71920	Your years here have equipped you with everything you need to take on the grand challenges of our
